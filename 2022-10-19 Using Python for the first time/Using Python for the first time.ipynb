    "# What is Python, Jupyter and Anaconda?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, Jupyter and Anaconda are three distinctly different applications that serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is the software that performs the actual instructions. Without Python installed on your computer or server, you would not be able to run any commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Jupyter, either using Jupyter Notebooks or JupyterLab, is the software that provides an interface to Python. It’s sometimes referred to as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Its purpose is to provide bells and whistles that can make Python easy to use and access. Other IDEs are also available for Python, though Jupyter is the most popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Anaconda is a distribution manager, which one can use to access Jupyter and other IDEs, storing everything within one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Where do I download Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to access and work with Python is through Anaconda. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you need Anaconda on your work laptop, you will need to raise a service request. \n",
    "\n",
    "To download on a personal latop, the following links can be used: https://www.anaconda.com/.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "To launch Anaconda, use the 'Anaconda Navigator'. After launching, you should a screen similar to the below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/Anaconda.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now click on 'launch' for JupyterLab to load up an instance of Jupyter. Once open, you should be greeted with something like the below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/Jupyter.png\" width=\"750\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening and saving a new script\n",
    "\n",
    "Now on the left hand side, simply navigate to the folder you would like to create a Python file in and then click on the Python3 button under 'Notebook' in the middle. Once done, you should get a screen like so.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/Notebook.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all files save automatically. You can also save by clicking the flopping disk on the top bar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are presented with a empty box in the middle known as a 'code chunk', where we write our code. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example if you type 2+2 in the box and run it, by either pressing the play button or using Ctrl+Enter, we will get 4. When ran, a new chunk appears automatically. You can click the '+' button to create additional boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has many in built functions you can use to perform specific tasks but additional packages are available that can make these tasks easier to perform or allow additional functionality compared to the base functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the script you can write notes to go with your code it you add # in front of any text it will make it as a note. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are packages? \n",
    "Packages are collections of Python functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format, created to add specific functionality. There are 10,000+ user contributed packages and growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to install a package\n",
    "Packages for Python can be installed using a program called Pip.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* First, navigate back to the launcher by clicking the blue '+' in the top left, just above your files.\n",
    "* Then, open the 'terminal'. \n",
    "* Finally, type `pip install package-name`, swapping \"package name\" with the name of the package you want to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mostly commonly used package for data manipulation is `pandas`. Lets install pandas using `pip install pandas` within the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a package\n",
    "Once installed, you need to use the `import` function to load the package you want to use on your script. For this demo, we will be using the following packages:\n"

    "## Getting help with a package\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a package there are functions which are “self contained” modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually take in some sort of data structure (value, vector, dataframe etc.), process it, and return a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each package, there is documentation produced which provides information on the different functions it contains and gives examples of how to use the function. These can be accessed by simply googling the documentation for the package. For example, here is the documentation for `pandas`: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide.\n",

    "# Working directory\n",
    "The working directory is the file path for the directory you are working in on your computer. This is the location Python will look in for any files you are trying to read in. It is also where Python will store any output you save by default.  Note: you can specify the file path when loading/saving if the working directory is not what you want/need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set working directory\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set the working directory to a specific folder on your computer, so for example a project folder where you may have data saved that you would like to upload in to Python. **Following the above example, you have already done this, by navigating to the desired folder using the bar on the left hand side.**\n",

    "# Loading Data into R\n",

    "\n",
    "## Load a CSV\n",
    "R has an inbuilt function to read in csv files (see code below).If you have set your working directory to the folder your data is saved in then you can use the following code and just add the name of the CSV file in the brackets. When you load the data in you need to give the dataframe you are creating in R a name So if for example you wanted to import a csv file called MyData and call the table first_table then you would use the following code. In the code you put the name you want to call the table in R first followed by <-\n",

For example you wanted to load in a CSV called Mydata2 and it was saved in a folder called CSVS in your person folder and you wanted to call it second_table then you would use the following code. Both the file path and the name of the CSV need to be included in the \"\". REMEMBER that the slashes in the file path should be forwards and not backwards. \n",

    "To load an excel file you can use a package called readXl (there are alternative packages for this also available). If you have installed tidyverse, this is one of the packages included. As above if you have set your working directory to the folder your excel spreadsheet is saved in then you just need to include the name of the excel file in the brackets.

In this example we are creating a data object called num_cyl to keep a record of the value. We also need to use a pipe to then use the summaries function, the pipe is %>% (or you might also see it written as  !>). The key board short cut to create the pipe symbol is Ctrl+Shift+M.\n",
