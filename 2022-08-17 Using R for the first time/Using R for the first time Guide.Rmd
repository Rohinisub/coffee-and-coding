# What is R and R studio?

R and RStudio are two distinctly different applications that serve different purposes.

* R is the software that performs the actual instructions. Without R installed on your computer or server, you would not be able to run any commands.

* RStudio is a software that provides an interface to R. It’s sometimes referred to as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Its purpose is to provide bells and whistles that can improve your experience with the R software.

# Where do I download R and R studio?
If you need R and R studio on your work laptop you will need to raise a service request. To download on a personal latop the following links can be used. 

* Download R - https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/

* Download RStudio - https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download

# Packages

## What are packages? 
Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format, created to add specific functionality. There are 10,000+ user contributed packages and growing.

## How to install a package
Packages for R can be installed from the CRAN package repository in two ways.This function will download the source code from CRAN and install the package (and any dependencies) locally on your computer. Depending on where R is installed you may need to reload a package each time you open R. You can set up a specific library for your packages to be installed so they wouldn't need to be installed each time. I won't be covering that in this course, but can provide details on how this can be done.  

* Using the Packages tab in the lower right hand side of the screen. You can click on the Install option and then in the packages box type in the package you want to load.

 * Using the install.packages function. The example code for this is below.  The example below is to install a package called Tidyverse which is a collection of packages that includes some of the most common ones used by the DALL team including dplyr and ggplot

```{Packages}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
## Using a package
Once installed you need to use the library function to install the package you want to use on your script.

If you are using more than one package the you need to load them all at the start of your script each one should have library and then the package name in brackets 



``` {Load Package}
library(tidyverse)
```
## Getting help with a package
Within a package there are functions which are “self contained” modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually take in some sort of data structure (value, vector, dataframe etc.), process it, and return a result. 
For each package in R there is documentation produced which provides information on the different function it contains and gives examples of how to use the function. These can be accessed in two main ways. 

* From the packages menu on the right hand side of the screen click on the name of the package and it will bring up the help screen with a list of the functions available. You can then click on the function you want help with and it will bring up a page which has a description of the function, an example of how to use it and an explanation of any additional arguments you can use with in the function. in the Example belo at the bottom it will also usually include some further examples

![group_by screen.](C:/Users/nidod/Documents/GitHub/coffee-and-coding/2022-08-17 Using R for the first time/Group_by.png)


* Using the help function (The example code for this is below). This will bring up the same documentation screen as above. Then you can select the function you want help with.

```{Help function}
help(package="dplyr")
```
