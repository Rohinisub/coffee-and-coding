# What is R and R studio?

R and RStudio are two distinctly different applications that serve different purposes.

* R is the software that performs the actual instructions. Without R installed on your computer or server, you would not be able to run any commands.

* RStudio is a software that provides an interface to R. It’s sometimes referred to as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Its purpose is to provide bells and whistles that can improve your experience with the R software.

# Where do I download R and R studio?
If you need R and R studio on your work laptop you will need to raise a service request. To download on a personal latop the following links can be used. 

* Download R - https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/

* Download RStudio - https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download

# Packages

## What are packages? 
Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format, created to add specific functionality. There are 10,000+ user contributed packages and growing.

## How to install a package
Packages for R can be installed from the CRAN package repository in two ways.This function will download the source code from CRAN and install the package (and any dependencies) locally on your computer. Depending on where R is installed you may need to reload a package each time you open R. You can set up a specific library for your packages to be installed so they wouldn't need to be installed each time. I won't be covering that in this course, but can provide details on how this can be done.  

* Using the Packages tab in the lower right hand side of the screen. You can click on the Install option and then in the packages box type in the package you want to load.  



![Installing the tidyverse package.](C:/Users/nidod/Documents/GitHub/coffee-and-coding/2022-08-17 Using R for the first time/Package screen.png)
 
 * Using the install.packages function. The example code for this is below.  The example below is to install a package called Tidyverse which is a collection of packages that includes some of the most common ones used by the DALL team including dplyr and ggplot. To run  the code you can copy and past this into a new R script and. To run a line of code in R you press control and return key on the line of code you want to run or at the end of a block of code if it is over more than one line.

```{Packages}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
## Using a package
Once installed you need to use the library function to install the package you want to use on your script.

If you are using more than one package the you need to load them all at the start of your script each one should have library and then the package name in brackets 



``` {Load Package}
library(tidyverse)
```
## Getting help with a package
Within a package there are functions which are “self contained” modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually take in some sort of data structure (value, vector, dataframe etc.), process it, and return a result. 
For each package in R there is documentation produced which provides information on the different function it contains and gives examples of how to use the function. These can be accessed in two main ways. 

* From the packages menu on the right hand side of the screen click on the name of the package and it will bring up the help screen with a list of the functions available. You can then click on the function you want help with and it will bring up a page which has a description of the function, an example of how to use it and an explanation of any additional arguments you can use with in the function. in the Example belo at the bottom it will also usually include some further examples 

![dplyr help screen.](C:/Users/nidod/Documents/GitHub/coffee-and-coding/2022-08-17 Using R for the first time/dplyr help screen.png)

![group_by screen.](C:/Users/nidod/Documents/GitHub/coffee-and-coding/2022-08-17 Using R for the first time/Group_by.png)


* Using the help function (The example code for this is below). This will bring up the same documentation screen as above. Then you can select the function you want help with.

```{Help function}
help(package="dplyr")
```
# Working directory
The working directory is just a file path on your computer that sets the default location of any files you read into R, or save out of R.

You can see what the current working directory of R is by using the following code

```{getwd}
getwd()
```
You can set the working directory to a specific folder on your computer, so for example a project folder where you may have data saved that you would like to upload in to R. To do this you would use the following code. NOTE - the slashes in the directory path are forwards and not backwards as they would be when you copy a file path from your computer. 

```{set working directory}
setwd("C:/Users/nidod/R")
```
# Loading Data into R
You can load many data formats in to R this session will cover reading in CSV and Excel files as these are the two most common file types you might want to load. 

## Load a CSV
R has an inbuilt function to read in csv files see code below.If you have set your working directory to the folder your data is saved in then you can use the following code and just add the name of the CSV file in brackets. When you load the data in you need to give the dataframe you are creating in R a name So if for example you wanted to import a csv file called MyData and call the table first_table then you would use the following code. In the code you put the name you want to call the table in R first followed by <-

```{read csv from WD}
first_table <- read_csv("Mydata.csv")
```
If the data you want to load is in a different location to your working directory then you would need to add the file path to where the data is saved to load the data in. For example you wanted to load in a CSV called Mydata2 and it was saved in a folder called CSVS in your person folder and you wanted to call it second_table then you would use the following code. Both the file path and the name of the CSV need to be included in the "". REMEMBER that the slashes in the file path should be forwards and not backwards. 

```{read CSV from different location}

second_table <- read_csv("C:/Users/nidod/CSVS/Mydata2.csv")
```

Once your data has loaded you will see it in the environment window in the top right of your screen. This tells you how many rows the table has (obs) and how many columns (variables).If you click on the name of the table you can then view the table.

![Environment screen.](C:/Users/nidod/Documents/GitHub/coffee-and-coding/2022-08-17 Using R for the first time/first_table.png)

## Load an excel file
To load an excel file you need to use a package called readXl. If you have installed tidyverse, this is one of the packages included. As above if you have set your working directory to the folder your excel spreadsheet is saved in then you just need to include the name of the excel file in the brackets. For example if you want to import Mydata3 and call it third_table then you would use the following code

```{read excel from WD}

thrid_table <- read_excel("Mydata3.xlsx")
```
Again as above if the excel spreadsheet is saved in a different location to your working directory then you would need to add the file path to where the data is saved to load the data in. For example you wanted to load in an excel spreadsheet called Mydata4 and it was saved in a folder called excel in your person folder and you wanted to call it fourth_table then you would use the following code. 

```{read excel from different location}
fourth_table <- read_excel("C:/Users/nidod/EXCEL/Mydata4.xlsx")
```

# Simple anaylsis in R 
For this section we are going to use one of the data sets pre-built in R called mtcars but any of the following analysis could be done on data sets you have loaded yourself. To load the data we use the following code

```{r}
mtcars <- mtcars
```

## count rows
There is a function in R to count rows. This will put the number of rows in the console in the bottom left side of the screen.

```{r}
nrow(mtcars)
```
## Count columns
