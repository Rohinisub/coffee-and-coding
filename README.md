# Coffee and Coding

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

This repository will hold all materials for Coffee and Coding sessions held by the NHS Business Services Authority.

The goal of these sessions is to provide a relaxed environment to share new skills and encourage people to pick up the keyboard and learn to code. The sessions will last 45 minutes to 1 hour and should include some kind of hands on code for others to try out your material.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Tools

If you are playing along there are a couple of free online interactive environments that can, depending on the session, be used to allow access to the materials to code along.

**Posit Cloud RStudio Environment**

This online tool requires the user to have a free account and will allow a project to be created based on this git repository:

-   [Posit cloud login](https://posit.cloud/content/yours?sort=name_asc)
-   [Guide to using posit cloud](posit%20cloud%20rstudio/Using%20Posit%20Cloud%20RStudio%20environment.pdf)

**Binder**

[Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sfdsa/HEAD) is a free online interactive environment to execute code in online with no signup or user accounts required. Launch the version which suits the session you are attending:

-   JupyterLab instance [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nhsbsa-data-analytics/coffee-and-coding/HEAD?urlpath=lab)
-   RStudio instance [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nhsbsa-data-analytics/coffee-and-coding/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)
-   Google colab instance [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb)

We also use GitHub Actions to automate the Binder build process.
