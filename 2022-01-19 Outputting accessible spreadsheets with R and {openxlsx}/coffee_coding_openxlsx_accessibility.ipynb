    "Along the way we will be referring to the Government Statistical Service's guidelines for improving accessibility in spreadsheet releases for the public. To start, we'll load in our data, then write a file with a single worksheet and add some formatting options. Then we'll move on to writing a workbook with multiple worksheets.\n",

Most of the GSS guidelines for creating spreadsheets are aimed at creating a better experience for anyone using screenreader technology.

If some whitespace is needed between two rows of data for visual reasons, it's possible to adjust the row height of either all rows or a specific row. Having the table style as \"none\" and filter option set to FALSE in the code avoids Excel's default table options, which do not meet accessibility standards. \n",
    "\n",
