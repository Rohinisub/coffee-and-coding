# Extracting data from images using Python and the cloud

In this session we'll introduce "Image Processing" and get hands on with images and explore how to manipulate (using Python) and extract data (using [AWS Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract), [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services), and [Google Cloud Vision APIs](https://cloud.google.com/vision)).

We'll start with the very basics and work through an example to compare each of the "Big 3" cloud providers.
